# Create a clculator by using the basic the basics I have Learned and the calculator have to do addition , subtraction , Divison , Multiplication

# But First I have to learn about the Operator things first 

# Operator 

# Arithmetic Operator 
# Addition --   +
# Subtraction --   -
#  Exponential --  **
# Divison --   /
#  fllor Divison --  //
# Modulus --   %


# Solution of the Project 

A = 6
B = 2
addAnswer = A + B
print("The answer of A addition B is " ,addAnswer)
subAnswer = A - B
print("The answer of A subtraction B is ",subAnswer )
expoAnswer = A ** B
print("The answer of A exponential B is ", expoAnswer)
DivAnswer = (A / B)
print("The answer of A Divison B is ",DivAnswer )
floorAnswer = A // B
print("The answer of A floorDivison B is ", floorAnswer)
Modulus = A % B
print("The answer of A Modulus B is ", Modulus)
